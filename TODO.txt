// Game mechanic ideas (how to make unique mechanics?)
// 0. Spikes
// 1. SLAM BOX (These should be improved. Add (1) the ability to add spikes to 
slamboxes and (2) the ability to connect slamboxes in "any" configuration)
// 3. One-way platforms
// 4. Teleporters
// 5. Lazers and light sensors?
// 6. Buttons which can be activated by the player?
// 7. Shrink and grow in size
// 8. Stoppers / catchers
// 9. Hold up hear me out. What about turrets / traps that insta-kill you if they get line of sight?
      They can be blocked with boxes and also killed
// what else?


Theme idea:
Take inspiration from DSFWAN albums? For example, we can have
- One section inspired by dream desert
- One inspired by above / below babylon's hanging gardens
- One inspired by Perli tal-Passat (Which basement kind of already is)
- One inspired by the purple album (name unknown)


Bug list:
- Sometimes spamming pause/play while respawning causes the player to not appear
  at all (SEVERITY: LOW)
- Dashing in the same direction as a moving slambox causes the player to hit the slambox and stop in mid 
  air (SEVERITY: LOW)
- 44100 Hz audio does not seem to work on arch, which is quite a huge problem
- Pausing while an area title card is playing makes it not fade away

Levels:
 - One-way platforms
 - Proper level transition sequence to avoid large slowdown due to asset loading
 - Level transitions (shader O_o)
 - Breathing lights
 - NPC stuff

// Revamped roadmap because I want to create a demo
// - Art/idea for level transitions
// - Add room title cards
// - Implement some kind of switch or lever as persistent progress
// - Finish slam animation
// - Remake dash animation
// - Resolve the many TODOs in the project (at least do a few of them)
// - Right now the game crashes if doors have a missing entity ref. Probably nice
//   to fix this or at least give a better warning in ebiten-LDTK.
// - Add a way to skip intro cutscene

// - Cheap hack for camera shake: Set the background color to the same as the darkest color in the tileset

// Post-demo: The design/code quality revamp:
// - Rewrite the overlay system from scratch because it's just so terrible and can't do what i want it to do
// - Remove the singletons. These should not exist
// - Review licensing so I don't get sued
// - Use the race condition checker...
// - Implement generalized input handler
// - Improve the asset loader, turn into actual editor
// - Create animation/sprite/audio asset files
// - Create shader asset files

FIX THE EDITOR
Consider switching into one repo for assets and one for code? or maybe that's not such
a good idea idk
Could also just reduce the size of the assets folder you know
