// Game mechanic ideas (how to make unique mechanics?)
// 0. Spikes
// 1. SLAM BOX (These should be improved. Add (1) the ability to add spikes to 
slamboxes and (2) the ability to connect slamboxes in "any" configuration)
// 9. Hold up hear me out. What about turrets / traps that insta-kill you if they get line of sight?
      They can be blocked with boxes and also killed
// 3. One-way platforms
// what else?


Theme idea:
Take inspiration from DSFWAN albums? For example, we can have
- One section inspired by dream desert
- One inspired by above / below babylon's hanging gardens
- One inspired by Perli tal-Passat (Which basement kind of already is)
- One inspired by the purple album (name unknown)


Bug list:
- Sometimes spamming pause/play while respawning causes the player to not appear
  at all (SEVERITY: LOW)
- 44100 Hz audio does not seem to work on arch, which is quite a huge problem

DEMO ROADMAP:
- Finish slam animation
- Create music for the first area + menu music
- Revamp & touch up sound effects
- Add credits/shoutout page (is for me) 
- Remake dash animation
- Create levels (at least 20!)
- Create website + web build

// Revamped roadmap because I want to create a demo
// - Finish slam animation
// - Remake dash animation
// - ABSOLUTELY need performance improvements
// - MORE slam effects: E.g. when slambox lands. Sound + particle effect

// Modularization rework. The following should be fleshed out as proper modules:
// - Slambox module. Includes all the basic logic for slamboxes 
//   with a collision grid, projecting boxes in the environment 
//   (slamming), chains, as well as slammable entities. For 
//   testing we can make a simple graphic that renders boxes,
//   environments etc. in various colors. Also maybe some debug 
//   stuff
// - NodeTree module. Includes a system for creating nodes, 
//   a tree structure, and a visualization tool for nodes.
// - Tilemap module. Improved auto-tiling features.
// - Music/sound module? Includes better mixing controls and 
//   stuff

// Post-demo: The design/code quality revamp:
// - Rewrite the overlay system from scratch because it's just so terrible and can't do what i want it to do
// - Remove the singletons. These should not exist
// - Use the race condition checker...
// - Implement generalized input handler
// - Improve the asset loader, turn into actual editor
// - Create animation/sprite asset files
