// Game mechanic ideas (how to make unique mechanics?)
// 1. I've already made the most interesting game mechanic known to mankind
//    It's smooth sailing from here
//    Surely :^)

// Implement lighting it would look so cool

(Priority: LOW) Fix the "bug" where single-screen-height rooms have two pixels of spare
camera space
(Priority: MEDIUM) Split the main Update function into subfunctions for various disjoint 
entity interactions
(Priority: MEDIUM) Separate input into its own file, generalize
(Priority: LOW) Make global state less global
(Priority: LOW) Make input buffer for movement inputs
(Priority: LOW) Improve rect so it has no dependency on ebitenLDTK
(Priority: MEDIUM) Make examples aka non-automated integration tests


// THE MAJOR GRAPHICS/GAME FEEL OVERHAUL
// - PARTICLE SYSTEMS
// - SHADOWS AND LIGHTING (NORMAL MAPPED)
// - CAMERA SHAKE
// - UPDATED ANIMATIONS
