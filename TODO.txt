(Priority: LOW) Fix the "bug" where single-screen-height rooms have two pixels of spare
camera space

Bug list:
- Sometimes spamming pause/play while respawning causes the player to not appear
  at all (SEVERITY: LOW)

// Revamped roadmap because I want to create a demo
// - Implement camera shake
// - Implement some kind of switch or smth as persistent progress
// - Proper level and scene transitions (dash from one level to the next)
// - Make some actual levels
// - Add level title cards
// - Finish slam animation
// - Add biome title cards
// - Remake dash animation
// - Resolve the many TODOs in the project (at least do a few of them)

// Post-demo: The design/code quality revamp:
// - UI sounds
// - Allow for run flag to start in a certain level
// - Remove the singletons. These should not exist
// - Try to make the packages more independent because right now they really aren't that great
// - (Consider) writing integration tests for packages like animation, rendering, sound, etc.
// - Make an overview of the design of the game
// - Create principles for the file structure. Right now it's kind of random. 
// - Review licensing so I don't get sued
// - Use the race condition checker...
// - Implement generalized input handler
// - Reconsider the 'data.go' files
// - Improve the asset loader, turn into actual editor
// - Create animation/sprite asset files

Consideration: asset manager:
Why do we need this? Well, we should be performing the loading of sprites in another thread
so that we can display a loading screen or something while loading our assets
It's obviously not feasible to just load every resource on startup
Another reason for the asset manager: Right now we are loading assets multiple times
because they aren't stored globally anywhere. This is resource inefficient, with an asset
manager we could load assets and then cache them for later

Note that it may only be necessary to load some assets on startup (i.e. those that 
take a lot of time to load)
