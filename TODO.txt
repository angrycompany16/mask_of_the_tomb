// Game mechanic ideas (how to make unique mechanics?)
// 0. Spikes
// 1. SLAM BOX (These should be improved. Add (1) the ability to add spikes to 
slamboxes and (2) the ability to connect slamboxes in "any" configuration)
// 9. Hold up hear me out. What about turrets / traps that insta-kill you if they get line of sight?
      They can be blocked with boxes and also killed
// 3. One-way platforms
// 4. Buttons... I might have to add buttons
// what else?


Bug list:
- Sometimes spamming pause/play while respawning causes the player to not appear
  at all (SEVERITY: LOW)
- 44100 Hz audio does not seem to work on arch, which is quite a huge problem
- Opening the game and then exiting from the main menu deletes the current save
- Random crash can occur when loading audio???

DEMO ROADMAP:
- Finish slam animation
- Create music for the first area + menu music
- Revamp & touch up sound effects
- Add credits/shoutout page (is for me) 
- Remake dash animation
- Create levels (at least 20!)
- Create website + web build

// Revamped roadmap because I want to create a demo
// - ABSOLUTELY need performance improvements
// - Create a system (a kind of spectator mode) for placing 
//   hand-painted assets into the world?
// - Make slambox particle effect work with chained, as well as 
//   multibox slamboxes.

// Modularization rework. The following should be fleshed out as proper modules:
// - NodeTree module. Includes a system for creating nodes, 
//   a tree structure, and a visualization tool for the node tree.
// - Music/sound module? Includes better mixing controls and 
//   stuff

// Post-demo: The design/code quality revamp:
// - Rewrite the overlay system from scratch because it's just so terrible and can't do what i want it to do
// - Remove the singletons. These should not exist
// - Use the race condition checker...
// - Implement generalized input handler
// - Improve the asset loader, turn into actual editor
// - Create animation/sprite asset files
