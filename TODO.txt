// Game mechanic ideas (how to make unique mechanics?)
// 1. I've already made the most interesting game mechanic known to mankind
//    It's smooth sailing from here
//    Surely :^)

(Priority: LOW) Fix the "bug" where single-screen-height rooms have two pixels of spare
camera space
(Priority: MEDIUM) Split the main Update function into subfunctions for various disjoint 
entity interactions
(Priority: MEDIUM) Separate input into its own file, generalize
(Priority: MEDIUM) Make examples aka non-automated integration tests

// THE MAJOR GRAPHICS/GAME FEEL OVERHAUL
// - PARTICLE SYSTEMS
// - SHADOWS AND LIGHTING (NORMAL MAPPED)
// - CAMERA SHAKE
// - UPDATED ANIMATIONS

// Roadmap for now (in order):

// - Add death/retry effect / retry screen (to start just copy celeste or something) 
// - Implement dear-imgui for faster debugging (this will be key later)
// ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ TODAY

// - Finish the asset loader, add loading screens
// - Add custom asset for UI systems
// - Implement particle systems, make asset loader etc.
// - Implement camera shake
// - Make the lighting system
// - Make examples for future reference/testing
// - Implement background color
// - Implement sound system
// - Start on levels
// - Make slambox positions persist on changing rooms (But probably not with quitting the game!)
// - Implement generalized input handler

// Backburner
// - Implement super cool animation technique from aartihificial

Consideration: asset manager:
Why do we need this? Well, we should be performing the loading of sprites in another thread
so that we can display a loading screen or something while loading our assets
It's obviously not feasible to just load every resource on startup
Another reason for the asset manager: Right now we are loading assets multiple times
because they aren't stored globally anywhere. This is resource inefficient, with an asset
manager we could load assets and then cache them for later
