# I'm making a game in Go

it's just going to be a small game. No need to worry about scope creep, right? (???)

To run the game for yourself, clone the repo and run 

```
  go run .
```

or

```
  go run examples/slamboxes/main.go
```

for a simple example.

If you discover any bugs, please raise an issue or something idk
