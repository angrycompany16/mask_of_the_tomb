# I'm making a game in Go

it's just going to be a small game. No need to worry about scope creep, right? (???)

To run the game for yourself, clone the repo and use

```
  go run .
```

or

```
  go run examples/slamboxes/main.go
```

for a simple example.

The game also includes a simple asset editor (although as of right now (03.04.25) it can only preview assets). To run it, use 

```
  go run editor/main.go
```

If you discover any bugs, please raise an issue or something idk
